# Lazy Evaluation Bug in Julia `if` statement
This repository demonstrates a potential issue related to lazy evaluation in Julia's `if` statement. The example function `myfunction` showcases how improper conditional checks can lead to unexpected behavior. The solution illustrates a way to mitigate this potential issue by ensuring that conditions are explicitly evaluated.

## Bug Description
In Julia, the `if` statement's condition is evaluated lazily. This behavior can cause unexpected results when the condition is not explicitly checked or contains potential errors. In the example, the code seems correct, but due to the lazy evaluation, it may not always return the expected results.

## Solution
The solution ensures that the condition is checked correctly and handles unexpected cases appropriately.  The corrected code explicitly evaluates the condition, preventing unexpected results caused by lazy evaluation.
